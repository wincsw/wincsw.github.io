            <p>
                Escapee started from the day we are thinking of what game to make. One of us really need to pee but
                couldn't find the toliet in our engineering building (<a
                    href="https://innowings.engg.hku.hk/innowing1/">InnoWing</a>). So we were like "why not just make
                this
                our game!".

            <br>
            You play as Ione, who wakes up alone in InnoWing without a student card and your bladder is almost full. You
            have
            7 minutes (tracked by the "Peedometer") untill you can't hold anymore. In these 7 minutes, you will need
            to
            explore rooms, solve
            puzzles, collect items, find the
            bathroom, so you don't pee your pants.

            <h3>Game Design</h3>
            <p>
                We developed the toilet inspriation into a full escape room concept. We sketched detailed room
                layouts
                and puzzle
                structures and then brought to life through pixel art.
            <div class="multiple_fig">
                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/projects/escapee/toiletSketch.png" alt="Sketch of the toilet room"
                        class="project_img">
                    <figcaption>Sketch of the toilet room (done by me)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/projects/escapee/toiletFinal.png" alt="Final look of the toilet room"
                        class="project_img">
                    <figcaption>Final look of the toilet room (thanks to my very talented teammates)</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            The game design focused on explorative
            gameplay, where every
            object is interactable with dialogue, encouraging players to pay attention to environmental details and
            discover
            InnoWing's inside jokes and meta-references (also to waste their time).
            <br><br>

            We designed multiple game systems to create tension and replayability: the Peedometer acts as a
            countdown timer to add
            time pressure, random event, and different endings.
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/projects/escapee/peedometer.png"
                    alt="Peedometer that shows the player's increaseing need to pee" class="project_img">
                <figcaption>Peedometer that shows the player's increasing need to pee</figcaption>
            </figure>

            The pixel art aesthetic, explorative gameplay, excape room concept, and multiple ending aspects are
            highly
            inspired by the clasic horror game "Ib".

            <h3>Why this game is GREAT!</h3>
            <p>
                It's silly. It's stupid. But it's one of the FAVORITE things I have ever made. The whole idea is
                absurd
                but everyone immediately
                gets it because we have all been there: the situation where you are desperately looking for a
                bathroom.
                <br><br>
                Also, setting it in our own university building
                made it even funnier because it's both ridiculous and painfully relatable. We have so much fun
                thinking of how to include the inside jokes and meta-references, even then they are not the main
                focus of the game play.
                <br><br>
                This is a school project, so we didn't make it to get money. But it reminds me the fun of games,
                they
                doesn't always need epic narratives, complex mechanics, or AAA graphics to be fun to play.
                Sometimes, a simple, silly concept executed with passion and creativity is all you need for a great
                game.
