            <p>
                We rarely pause, listen, and think of the soundscapes in our city, but they carries information about
                activity, culture,
                atmosphere, and time. These are continuously shaped by technological, social, and environmental changes,
                and thus are a
                refection of the transformation of our urban environment. So, can sound serve as a medium for reflecting
                on and
                imagining urban futures? By making sound the primary medium for speculation, we hoped to create space
                for reflection in
                that invites interpretation rather than prescribing meaning. This project used design fiction
                methodologies and spatial
                audio in AR to create an immersive experience inviting audiences to listen to and question how cities
                might evolve.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Design Concept</h3>
            <p>
                We proposed a speculative system that uses a type of hypothetical color-changing bioluminescence
                mushroom to creating a
                lighting system. In the system, there will be a "mama mushroom" that controls how the network of "baby
                mushrooms" lit
                up, mimicking how real fungi communicate through mycelial connections.
                <br><br>
                The design challenges typical smart home aesthetics of sleek minimalism, instead embracing organic
                forms, handcrafted
                materials, and the "semi-chaotic blend" characteristic of solarpunk futures—where advanced biotechnology
                coexists with
                earthy, living surroundings.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>
                We used the KTH open-air square in Stockholm as our focus, where we explore how to pair up soundscapes
                that are/will be present in the years 2025 and 2040.
                <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/projects/urbanSound/kthFountain.jpg" alt="KTH open-air square" class="project_img">
                <figcaption>The KTH open-air square</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>

            We use design fiction as our starting point of our design. The process began with mapping current
            phenomena (e.g. global
            warming, EU-Russia tensions, AI advancement) onto a design fiction matrix to ground speculation on real
            trends while
            identifying potential future events like declining biodiversity, electric vehicle adoption, stricter
            immigration
            policies, and international conflicts.
            <br>

                    class="project_img">
                <figcaption>Design fiction matrix</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            We also created "what if" scenarios to imagine how these forces might reshape urban sound: What if global
            warming
            continues? What if self-driving cars become reliable? What if society becomes more conservative? These
            questions guided
            the soundscape composition.
            <br><br>
            The present soundscapes used real recordings from four corners of the square at different times and days,
            layered with
            additional sounds to emphasize aspects we wanted to contrast with the future. Future soundscapes with our
            speculated
            changes, such as less birdsong due to species decline, electric vehicles replacing oil cars, war alerts, and
            more.
            <br><br>
            The soundscapes were structured in three layers (human, mechanical, natural) based on how urban sounds are
            categorized,
            with each corner emphasizing different layers based on its location and characteristics.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                When the AR application detects the image anchor, four virtual "windows" will appear. Each window
                displayed a photo of
                one of the corners of the square, acting as a portal to that corner's soundscape. As visitors moved
                through the physical
                space, sound sources shifted spatially and volumetrically based on their position, creating an embodied
                experience where
                physical movement shaped what they heard.

            Rotating the device between upright and upside-down gradually transitions the soundscape between present
            (2025) and
            future (2040), with a clock interface indicating the year. This interaction mimics how clocks hands runs,
            focusing on
            fluency and pliability, for a responsive and intuitive control for navigating time through physical gesture.

            <h3>Responses</h3>
            <p>
                We asked participant to sketch how they see the future of urban space after experiencing this
                installation. The
                responses were pretty divergent. Some participants sketched dystopian futures with war, extreme weather,
                technological
                surveillance, separation from loved ones, and expressed they feel stress and pessimistic for the future.
                Others imagined
                hopeful, greener futures with more natural sounds and wrote about feeling hopeful.
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/projects/urbanSound/responses.png"
                    alt="Drawings and writings from the participants for their idea of urban future after experiencing the installation"
                    class="project_img">
                <figcaption>Drawings and writings from the participants for their idea of urban future after

            </figure>
            <br>

            Even though our own speculation is a bit more leaning on the pessimistic side, this shows how the
            installation sparks
            different imaginations of the future that are outside of the creator (us) perspective, showing that sound
            can be a
            speculative medium that leaves room for personal interpretation and critical imagination.
