            <p>
                What will smart home technology look like if it is based on ecological systems rather than
                energy-intensive, surveilling
                smart home network? Based on the idea of solarpunk, we question if our homes can functioned more like
                living ecosystems,
                and if system connection design came from nature rather than a centralized control systems.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Design Concept</h3>
            <p>
                We want to reimagin a home lighting system that draws inspiration from bioluminescence (the ability to
                illuminate
                some organism
                have) and mycelial networks (fungal's webs that connect and communicate across with each other). The
                design came from nature rather than a centralized control systems.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, we designed a speculative system that uses a type of hypothetical color-changing
                bioluminescence
                mushroom to creating a
                lighting system. In the system, there will be a "mama mushroom" that controls how the network of "baby
                mushrooms" lit
                up, mimicking how real fungi communicate through mycelial connections.

            </figure>
            <br>
            This design challenges the typical smart home aesthetics of sleek minimalism, instead embracing organic
            forms, handcrafted materials, and the "semi-chaotic blend" characteristic of solarpunk futures, where
            advanced biotechnology
            coexists with earthy, living surroundings.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                A <a href="../other/mushroomVideoPrototype.mp4">video prototype</a> illustrated how the full speculative
                system would function in a home context. The mama
                mushroom will be the control placed in different rooms. It can control the path the baby mushrooms light
                up. The light trail will lead to different rooms, with the trail to each room having different colors
                (match with the mama mushroom's color), allowing user to navigate in the dark.
                <br><br>
                The mama mushroom's cap rotates to select which room's pathway should illuminate. The light trail of the
                baby mushrooms will light up when the user pads the mama
                mushroom, using a speculative fungi mycelial networks that can sense and respond to touch.
                <br><br>
                We built a working prototype to illustrate the physical and tactile interactions of the design.

                <figcaption>Physical prototype of the mushroom system</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            This prototype have a rotation mechanisms to achieve the rotation of the mama mushroom's cap. We also used
            Arduino, touch sensors, and color-changing LEDs to create the interaction of padding mama mushroom and
            then the baby mushroom change color.

            </div>

            For the mushrooms, we used worbla plastic (shaping with the help of clay molds) and other
            translucent materials to allow the light to shine through and create a bioluminescent aesthetic. We also
            decorated the mushroom with moss like decorations to create a more earthy feel.
