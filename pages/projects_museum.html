            <p>
                How can we design museum experiences that foster emotional and ethical connections between visitors and
                artifacts,
                rather than just passive observation? Traditional museum experiences often position visitors as
                observers and artifacts
                as objects inside the glass walls. Working with the concept of interdependence, this project focus on
                how visitors and
                artifacts mutually shape each other through encounter and attention to explored how museum interactions
                could embody an
                "ecology of care".
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>
                We followed the Double Diamond process, beginning with understanding the problem space. First handed
                were collected
                through interviews and museum diaries, where we coded, clustered, and ranked the themes to discover that
                visitors had
                diverse exploration styles and wanted more personal, meaningful engagement with artifacts. We also
                conducted a
                literature review on cultural user experience and learning to ground our understanding of how people
                interact and form
                connections in museum contexts.

            </figure>
            <br>
            During ideation and development phase, we explored various approaches through drawing different sketches,
            where we finalized on a system that can summarize the users' visit while allowing them to engage with
            artifacts
            they engage with.

            </figure>
            <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Design Concept</h3>
            <p>
                The final design is a system where visitors could
                use a wristband to scan artifacts they find interesting throughout their visit. At the end, a Visit
                Visualizer machine
                would generate a post-card like physical personalized report highlighting the origins and ethical
                dimensions of their
                selected artifacts, creating a moment of reflection on what drew their attention and the ethical
                implications those
                artifact might involve.

                    <img src="../images/projects/museum/storyboard.jpg" alt="storyboard of the user experience"
                        class="project_img">
                    <figcaption>Storyboard of the user experience of the system (btw I drew this!)</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>System workflow</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            The system aimed to be unobtrusive during the visit while
            creating a meaningful takeaway that extended reflection beyond the museum space. It also caters to different
            exploration styles (e.g. linear and non-linear, solo and multi-user), as it preserve the visitors' agency
            and social interaction with others.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Prototypeing & User Testing</h3>
            <p>
                We made a prototype of the touchscreen interface of the Visit Visualizer station and conducted user
                testing
                with prototype of the wristband and scanner in a mock up museum. There are also mock up of the physical
                personalized
                report and instruction pamphlet. Additional to the mockup prototype, we also created a video prototype
                to illustrate the user experience of the system in a museum context.
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/projects/museum/prototype.png"
                    alt="Prototype of the wristband system (bottom left), touchscreen interface (top left), personalized report (top right), instruction pamphlet (bottom right)"
                    class="project_img">
                <figcaption>Prototype of the wristband system (bottom left), touchscreen interface (top left),
                    personalized report (top right),
                    instruction pamphlet (bottom right)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>


            We conducted user testing with Wizard of Oz method and the mockup prototype. The results shows that having a
            tangible report created a bridge between the museum experience and visitors' ongoing
            thinking and make the connections and questions they had formed about ethical responsibilities toward the
            artifacts and
            cultures visible.
